How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

By running and testing the code, I was able to determine that it ran with 0 errors as well as pass the JUNit tests that were developed to test each function of the code.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

I would interpret the user needs by asking for their requirements of the application and what were their priorities for using the application.

How do I approach designing software?

I approach software from a straight forward standpoint, as I like to create a baseline and develop what is required and needed before
adding any extra features.
